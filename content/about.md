In a previous life, I worked on cross-functional projects in energy as an applied ML scientist w/ PETRONAS Research. Currently I build domain-specific generative AI applications as a technical co-founder at V-Cred. 

I code in my spare time, either for amusement ([tnwei/vqgan-clip-app](https://github.com/tnwei/vqgan-clip-app), [These Nebulae Do Not Exist](https://tnwei.github.io/thesenebulaedonotexist/)), out of curiosity ([tnwei/waternet](https://github.com/tnwei/waternet), [tnwei/intrinsic-dimension](https://github.com/tnwei/intrinsic-dimension)), or to scratch personal itches ([tnwei/python-rle](https://github.com/tnwei/python-rle), [tnwei/msia-covid-api](https://github.com/tnwei/msia-covid-api), [tnwei/mlflow-docker](https://github.com/tnwei/mlflow-docker)).

I hike semi-regularly on weekends. There's a lot of good places to go in the KL / Klang valley area.

I believe in my social responsibilty to raise and train the next generation of industry. I show up semi-actively at hackathons to mentor students, and I also train Team Malaysia for international AI olympiads.

## Working with me (as a colleague / as a staff / as a mentee etc)

+ https://nohello.net/en/
+ Believe that your best days are yet to come

## Seldomly Asked Questions

+ If I can study anything more in the world for leisure, I'd love to study typography and architecture. I find it fascinating how artful design can evoke certain emotions in people
+ Favourite radio drama: Ace Combat / Project Wingman
+ Favourite coding language: English (what language do you write your comments in?)
+ Once spent two whole years knitting a scarf
+ Have a lot of ideas but none of them make money
+ Sabbatical ideas: do AI projects for bio-conservation, write, build small fun projects for the pure sake of it
