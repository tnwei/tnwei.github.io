I joined Petronas Research as a data scientist after getting my petroleum engineering degree from Texas A&M. I started out doing product R&D on a variety of projects, involving cross-functional teams of various disciplines. After earning my stripes from leading projects, I'm now working on industry-centric machine learning research. Current research interests are focused on concept drift and domain adaptation.

I code in my spare time, either for amusement ([tnwei/vqgan-clip-app](https://github.com/tnwei/vqgan-clip-app), [These Nebulae Do Not Exist](tnwei.github.io/thesenebulaedonotexist/)), out of curiosity ([tnwei/waternet](https://github.com/tnwei/waternet), [tnwei/intrinsic-dimension](https://github.com/tnwei/intrinsic-dimension)), or to scratch personal itches ([tnwei/python-rle](https://github.com/tnwei/python-rle), [tnwei/msia-covid-api](https://github.com/tnwei/msia-covid-api), [tnwei/mlflow-docker](https://github.com/tnwei/mlflow-docker)).

I hike regularly on weekends. There's a lot of good places to go in the KL / Klang valley area.

I think the most important language to in machine learning for the next decade is English. Because that's what the docs will be written in.
